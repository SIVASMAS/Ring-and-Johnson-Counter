# Ring-and-Johnson-Counter
A Ring Counter is a digital counter where the last flip-flop's output loops back to the first, generating a cyclic sequence. A Johnson Counter, or Twisted Ring Counter, is similar but inverts the output of the last flip-flop before feeding it back, creating a unique sequence of states.
